# Yolo_Object_Tracking

A real-time system that detects, tracks, counts, and estimates object speed in video footage using YOLOv8. The system is packaged as a Flask web app, fully Dockerized for easy deployment.

🔧 Tech Stack: YOLOv8, OpenCV, Flask, Python, Docker, Git

✅ End-to-End Setup:

📦 Model: Trained YOLOv8 for detecting objects like vehicles and pedestrians.

🧠 Tracking: Integrated ByteTrack for tracking objects across frames.

🔄 Counting: Implemented both global and region-based object counting logic.

⚡ Speed Estimation: Calculated object speed using pixel displacement over time.

🌐 Web App: Built a user-friendly Flask interface to upload videos and display results.

📊 Dashboard: Shows object counts, IDs, speed stats, and logs.

💻 Git Integration: Managed code versioning, branching, and collaboration via GitHub.
